# Fit-To-Scrape

Current status of this homework:
1.  Scrape works.
2.  Display of scrape is json only.
3.  I believe all routes are done, except for submit.
4.  Specifically, submit needs to tie the note _id to the correct article.
5.  The display for the db scrape data and the notes is written, but untested.
6.  The front end is ugly, but more importantly does not have all the appropriate ties
    to the routes.

    I will submit what I have.  It runs, and does some things.
    I will not add this to my portfolio until it works....all the way.
